# Fever Detection using multiple machine learning approaches

In this notebook, I tackle the dataset presented in "Infrared Thermography for Measuring Elevated Body Temperature: Clinical Accuracy, Calibration, and Evaluation.",  Quanzeng Wang, Yangling Zhou, Pejman Ghassemi, David McBride, J. Casamento, T. Pfefer. Sensors, 2022. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22010215 

The data can be found here https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/925/infrared+thermography+temperature+dataset

I achieved an F1 score of 0.807018 when predicting if subjects have fever or not.
